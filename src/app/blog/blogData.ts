  <h3 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What Constitutes a Dental Emergency?</h3>
  <p class="mb-2">Not every dental issue requires a midnight dash to the emergency room. A dental emergency typically involves:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li><strong>Severe, uncontrollable pain</strong> that keeps you awake</li>
    <li><strong>Significant bleeding</strong> that won't stop</li>
    <li><strong>Trauma to the mouth</strong> or knocked-out teeth</li>
    <li><strong>Facial swelling</strong> that could affect breathing</li>
    <li><strong>Signs of infection</strong> with fever</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> Severe, throbbing pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter medication? That's an emergency. A small chip with no pain? That can wait.

            <div class="faq">
                <strong class="text-lg">Q1: Should I go to the emergency room for a dental emergency?</strong><br>
                A: Go to the ER for severe infections with facial swelling, uncontrolled bleeding, or facial trauma. For most dental emergencies, contact an emergency dentist directly - they can provide definitive treatment that ERs typically cannot.
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <strong class="text-lg">Q2: How much will emergency dental treatment cost in Harrisburg?</strong><br>
                A: Costs vary widely: simple procedures ($100-300), complex treatments ($500-2000+). Many practices offer payment plans, and some insurance covers emergency visits. Call ahead to discuss costs and payment options.
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <strong class="text-lg">Q3: Can I use superglue to reattach a broken crown?</strong><br>
                A: Never use superglue! It damages teeth and restorations, making proper repair difficult or impossible. Use denture adhesive or toothpaste temporarily, then see a dentist immediately.
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <strong class="text-lg">Q4: What should I do if my child knocks out a baby tooth?</strong><br>
                A: Don't try to replant baby teeth. Clean blood with warm water, control bleeding with pressure, and contact your pediatric dentist to check for fragments and assess permanent tooth development.
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <strong class="text-lg">Q5: How can I tell if tooth pain needs emergency care?</strong><br>
                A: Seek emergency care for severe pain unresponsive to medication, pain with fever/facial swelling, or pain following mouth trauma. If pain prevents normal sleeping, eating, or functioning, don't wait - call an emergency dentist immediately.

</section>

<section class="mb-8">
  <h3 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What Is a Root Canal?</h3>
 <p>A root canal is a specialized dental treatment that clears out infection from deep within the tooth. The process involves removing the damaged or infected pulp (soft tissue inside the root), cleaning and disinfecting the inside, and sealing it to prevent further infection.
 </p>
</section>


<section class="mb-8">
  <h3 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Root Canals Are Important</h3>
 <p>If ignored, a tooth infection can lead to serious complications—like abscesses, jawbone damage, and even tooth loss. A root canal saves the tooth while eliminating pain and infection.

  <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding Tooth Pain</h2>
 <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 ml-8"><li> When Is Tooth Pain Serious?</li></h4>
 <p class="mb-2">Not every toothache needs a root canal. If you’ve got discomfort that just won’t quit, it’s probably time to see your dentist.
 </p>
  <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 ml-8"><li>Sudden vs Chronic Pain</li></h4>
 <p class="mb-2">Sudden sharp pain while chewing might mean a cracked tooth or exposed nerve. A constant, low-grade toothache could mean there’s a more serious infection brewing beneath the surface.
 </p>
   <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2 ml-8"><li>Nighttime Sensitivity</li></h4>
 <p class="mb-2">If your tooth pain wakes you up at night or worsens when you lie down, it’s a red flag.
 </p>
 </ul>
</section>

<section class="mb-8">
<h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Top 5 Warning Signs You Could Need a Root Canal</h2>
 <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Persistent Tooth Pain</h4>
 <p>Constant pain is the most obvious indicator. It can radiate to your jaw or other teeth and often worsens over time. If OTC meds don't help, you should see a <strong> dentist in Harrisburg</strong> right away.
 </p>
</section>


<section class="mb-8">
 <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Sensitivity to Hot and Cold</h4>
 <p>Feeling a sharp zing when you drink coffee or eat ice cream? Ongoing sensitivity to temperature might be your tooth's way of signaling a hidden infection.
 </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-8">
 <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Swollen or Tender Gums</h4>
 <p>Localized swelling, especially with tenderness, often means there's an underlying issue. If your gums are inflamed near a painful tooth, it could be time for a root canal.
 </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-8">
 <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Tooth Discoloration</h4>
 <p>Darkening of the tooth (gray or brown hues) is usually caused by internal damage or dying pulp tissue. Getting a root canal can eliminate the infection and help preserve your natural tooth.
 </p>
</section>

<section class="mb-8">
 <h4 class="text-md md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. A Bump or Pimple on the Gums</h4>
 <p>These are often signs of an abscess—a serious infection that can spread. They may leak pus and leave a bad taste in your mouth. This is something that needs prompt attention from an emergency dentist in Harrisburg.
 </p>
</section>


<section class="mb-8">
  <h2 class="text-md md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why You Shouldn’t Ignore These Signs</h2>
